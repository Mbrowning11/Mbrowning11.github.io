<center>Michael Jackson, born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer who became one of the most influential entertainers of all time. Known as the "King of Pop," he started his career as a child with the Jackson 5 and later achieved monumental success as a solo artist. His albums Thriller (1982), the best-selling album of all time, and Bad (1987) solidified his place in music history. Jackson was renowned for his innovative music videos, like "Billie Jean" and "Beat It," his iconic dance moves, especially the moonwalk, and his humanitarian work. Despite personal controversies, his legacy as a musical pioneer endures.</center>
