<center>The Smiths were an influential English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982, featuring vocalist Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. Known for their jangly guitar sound and Morrissey's poetic lyrics, they helped define the 1980s British indie scene. Their albums, like The Queen Is Dead (1986), are considered landmarks, and though the band disbanded in 1987, their impact on music remains strong.</center>
