<center>Oasis is a British rock band formed in Manchester in 1991, led by brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.<br>Known for their distinctive blend of Britpop and alternative rock, they gained international fame in the<br>mid-1990s with albums like Definitely Maybe (1994) and (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995).<br>Their hit songs, such as "Wonderwall," "Don't Look Back in Anger," and "Champagne Supernova,"<br>became anthems of the era. Oasis was famous not only for their music but also for the Gallagher<br>brothers' tumultuous relationship, which eventually led to the band's breakup in 2009.
