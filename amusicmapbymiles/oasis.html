<center>Oasis is a British rock band formed in Manchester in 1991, led by brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher. Known for their distinctive blend of Britpop and alternative rock, they gained international fame in the mid-1990s with albums like Definitely Maybe (1994) and (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995). Their hit songs, such as "Wonderwall," "Don't Look Back in Anger," and "Champagne Supernova," became anthems of the era. Oasis was famous not only for their music but also for the Gallagher brothers' tumultuous relationship, which eventually led to the band's breakup in 2009.</center>
