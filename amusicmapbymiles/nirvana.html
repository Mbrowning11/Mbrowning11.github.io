Nirvana was an American rock band formed in 1987 in Aberdeen, Washington, by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. They played a key role in popularizing the grunge movement of the early 1990s, blending punk rock and heavy guitar distortion. Their 1991 album Nevermind, featuring the iconic hit "Smells Like Teen Spirit," brought them worldwide fame and is often credited with bringing alternative rock into the mainstream. Nirvana's raw sound and Cobain's introspective lyrics resonated with Generation X. The band ended in 1994 following Cobain's tragic death. Their influence on rock music remains significant.
