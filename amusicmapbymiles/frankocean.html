<center>Frank Ocean, born Christopher Edwin Breaux on October 28, 1987, is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Known for his introspective lyrics and genre-blending style, Ocean first gained fame with his critically acclaimed 2012 mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra. His debut studio album Channel Orange (2012) earned widespread praise, winning a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. His follow-up album Blonde (2016) was hailed as a masterpiece, further establishing his reputation as a boundary-pushing artist. Ocean's music explores themes of love, identity, and existentialism, and he remains a highly influential figure in modern R&B and pop.</center>
