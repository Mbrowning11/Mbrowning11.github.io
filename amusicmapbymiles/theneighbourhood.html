<center>The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock band formed in 2011 in Newbury Park, California. The group consists of lead vocalist Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, bassist Mikey Margott, and drummer Brandon Fried. Known for their moody, atmospheric sound blending indie rock, R&B, and electronic influences, they gained widespread attention with their 2013 debut album I Love You, featuring the hit single "Sweater Weather." Their music often explores themes of love, introspection, and existentialism, maintaining a distinct black-and-white visual aesthetic throughout their branding.</center>
