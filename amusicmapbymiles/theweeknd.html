<center>The Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer. Known for his moody, atmospheric sound that blends R&B, pop, and electronic influences, he first gained attention with his 2011 mixtape House of Balloons. His breakout album Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) featured hits like "Can't Feel My Face" and "The Hills." With albums like Starboy (2016) and After Hours (2020), which includes the global smash "Blinding Lights," The Weeknd has cemented his place as one of the most influential artists of his generation.</center>
