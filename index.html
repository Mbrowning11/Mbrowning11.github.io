<h1>Scrambled Eggs: A Surfer's Recipe</h1>
<br>
<p>
Dude, a killer plate of scrambled eggs is all about keepin’ it light and fluffy, ya know? You wanna cook ‘em low and slow, so they stay soft and creamy, not all dry and gnarly. A little butter or oil gives it that smooth, rich vibe, and just a pinch of salt and pepper for flavor. If you're feelin' fancy, toss in some milk or cream for extra creaminess, and maybe a sprinkle of herbs like chives. But for real, it’s all about that mellow, custardy texture—don’t let 'em get too cooked or, like, rubbery. Keep it smooth, bro!</p>
<br>
<h2>Gnarly Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>3 eggs</li>
<li>A little butter</li>
<li>Splash of milk</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>Optional: chives or parsley for that fancy vibe</li></em>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>The Game Plan:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Crack those eggs into a bowl, give 'em a good whisk—like, get some air in there, man! You want ‘em to be all mixed up, no chunks.</li>

<li>Heat a pan over low heat, like real low, bro. Toss in that butter, let it melt but don't let it burn, okay?</li>

<li>Pour in the eggs and just let ‘em chill. Don’t rush ‘em, dude—stir slowly with a spatula. You want to move them around gently, like waves, not too fast.</li>

<li>As they start to set, keep stirring. You want ‘em soft and creamy, not dry. If you’re feelin' the creaminess, add a little splash of milk or cream now.</li>

<li>Season it up with a pinch of salt and pepper. Keep stirring until they’re, like, soft and just barely done. Don’t let ‘em get all brown and crispy!</li>

<li>Take ‘em off the heat just before they’re fully cooked, 'cause they’ll keep cooking, dude.</li>

<li>If you're going next level, toss some herbs on top for that fresh flavor.</li>
</ol>
