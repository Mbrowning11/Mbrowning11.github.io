<center>Radiohead is an English rock band formed in 1985, known for their innovative and experimental approach to music. Led by frontman Thom Yorke, the band gained worldwide fame with their 1997 album OK Computer, which was praised for its complex soundscapes and themes of alienation. Their earlier hits like "Creep" and "High and Dry" showcase a more alternative rock style, but over time, Radiohead incorporated electronic, ambient, and experimental elements, as seen in albums like Kid A (2000) and In Rainbows (2007). They are celebrated for pushing the boundaries of rock music and maintaining critical acclaim throughout their career.
